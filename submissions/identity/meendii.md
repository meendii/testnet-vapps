## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Zero-Knowledge Citizenship Verification
- **Category**: identity

### Description
This vApp solves the privacy dilemma in digital identity verification. Users can prove their citizenship/nationality without exposing sensitive personal data like ID numbers, names, or addresses. It enables access to country-specific services while maintaining complete privacy of identification documents.

### SL Integration  
Will leverage Soundness Layer's Zero-Knowledge proof infrastructure for secure verification without revealing underlying identity data. Uses SL's decentralized verification network to validate citizenship proofs and store verification states on-chain while keeping personal data completely private.

## Technical
### Architecture
- User inputs national identification documents through secure interface
- Generate ZK circuits proving citizenship without revealing personal details
- Submit proofs to Soundness Layer for verification
- Applications can verify citizenship status through SL APIs
- Modular design supporting various government ID formats globally


### Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with secure input handling
- **Backend**: Node.js for proof generation and API integration
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + Sui integration
- **Storage**: Local encrypted storage + WALRUS for proof templates
- **ZK Framework**: Circom for proof circuits

### Features
1. Multi-country national ID format support (various government-issued identification documents)
2. Privacy-preserving citizenship verification without revealing personal data
3. Real-time proof generation and verification system
4. Developer APIs for seamless third-party integration

# Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Research ZK circuit design for ID verification
- [ ] Basic citizenship proof generation
- [ ] SL testnet integration
- [ ] Simple web interface demo

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Support for multiple ID formats
- [ ] Production-ready verification system
- [ ] Developer documentation and APIs
- [ ] Security audit and testing

## Innovation
First privacy-preserving citizenship verification on Soundness Layer. Unique because it solves real compliance issues for global applications while maintaining user privacy. Enables new use cases like anonymous voting, region-specific services, and privacy-compliant KYC processes.

## Contact
Primary contact through GitHub @meendii and Discord. Will share development updates in SoundnessLabs Discord community and maintain project documentation on GitHub repository.
